# hello-world

Greetings and Salutations!

My name is William Jenkins, and I am a multimedia specialist & digital producer. I'm a 29-year-old self-starter, that was raised in a military family, where I learned the importance of leading a team and supporting one under the guidance of another leader. I've always had a passion for creating & growing, especially when it came to media of all kinds (Digital, Print, Music, etc.), and thankfully that has allowed me to pursue a profession in helping other organizations grow while they strengthen and expand my skillset.
